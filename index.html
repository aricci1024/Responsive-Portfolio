      <p>My name is Alexander Ricci and I live in Berkeley, CA. I graduated from Tulane University in 2013
         with Bachelors of Science in Geology. After graduating, I moved back to Berkeley where I got a
         position in a laboratory as an Asbestos Analyst. After working there for a few months, I accepted
         a position as a Geologist at a consulting firm working in remediation. Since January of 2017, I 
         have been pursuing a Masters of Finance degree through Pennsylvania State University with an 
         expected graduation date of June 2018. I left my position as a Geologist in March of 2017 to focus 
         on pursuing my masters degree. In mid-February of this year (2018) I began a coding program with 
         an expected completion date of July of 2018. I hope to combine the knowledge gained in the coding 
         class to expand and elevate my studies in finance. </p>
